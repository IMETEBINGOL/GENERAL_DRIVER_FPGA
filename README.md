# SENSOR DRIVER REPOSITORIES
## The aim of repository
-   The aim of this repository is to develop firmware, hardware and software to driver common sensor such as tempature sensor and accelerometer.
-   The basic communication interface such as I2C , SPI and UART is implemented.

## Directories 
-   FIRMWARE: The HDL sources and development.

## TODO
- ~~Make all simulation (testbench) fully automated.~~
- ~~Prepare the TCL command firmware (HDL) compilation~~ 
- FIX ERROR IN UART 
- WRITE PYTHON CODE FOR UART
