# SENSOR DRIVER REPOSITORIES
## The aim of repository
-   The aim of this repository is to develop firmware, hardware and software to drive common sensor such as tempature sensor and accelerometer.
-   The basic communication interface such as I2C , SPI and UART is implemented.

## Directories 
-   FIRMWARE: The HDL sources and development.
-   SOFTWARE: The python, C and assembly source codes

## TODO
- ~~Make all simulation (testbench) fully automated.~~
- ~~Prepare the TCL command firmware (HDL) compilation~~ 
- ~~FIX ERROR IN UART~~ 
- ~~WRITE PYTHON CODE FOR UART~~
- add git ignore
- write general spi and spi command handler
- write fully automated test for top
